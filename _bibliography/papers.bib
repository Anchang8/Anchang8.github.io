  title     = {CaPTURe: Cartoon Pose Transfer Using Reverse Attention},
  abstract  = {Most of the previous pose transfer methods require additional input data such as joint keypoints of the target pose extracted by a pre-trained network in a human domain. However, in the fields where cartoon characters are used, such as animation or webtoons, the body proportions and structures of the characters differ from those of actual people, so it is improper to extract additional data using the pre-trained network in the human domain. Even if the network is newly trained in the cartoon domain, expensive data labeling is necessary. As a result, most of the previous pose transfer methods are unsuitable to utilize in the cartoon domain. To address these issues, we propose a Cartoon Pose Transfer network (CaPTURe) that can successfully perform pose transfer in the cartoon domain with only target images and no other input data. Our proposed CaPTURe receives identity and pose source images and extracts information from each source image using effectively designed encoders for cartoon pose transfer. Then the network decodes the identity and pose information with an attention module that makes the network generate the desired conditions more accurately. Here, we adopt the attention mechanism to properly generate the desired identity. On the other hand, we utilize reverse attention to generate the desired pose more precisely, which excludes the identity information of the pose feature and allows us to use only the pose information. Consequently, through comparative experiments using a cartoon domain dataset, CaPTURe shows quantitative results higher by 4.7% in L1 Distance, 0.1% in SSIM, and 0.8% in LPIPS, as well as being more qualitatively superior to the previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that CaPTURe is capable of achieving effective pose transfer not just in the cartoon domains, but also in the human domains, as evidenced by our experiments on a human domain dataset.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
