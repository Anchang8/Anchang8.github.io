I am a 2nd year M.S. student in Electronic Engineering at Yeungnam University. I am a member of the Intelligent Computer Vision Software Lab [ICVSLab](https://pogary.yu.ac.kr/members.html) at Yeungnam University, advised by Prof. Hyun-Chul Choi. Previously, I completed my B.S. in Electronic Engineering at Yeungnam University.

My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning, particularly in generative models (e.g., GAN, Diffusion Models, and VAE), medical image processing (e.g., Landmark detection on X-ray image), and machine learning for semiconductor processing.

If you are interested in my research projects, please feel free to contact me.
